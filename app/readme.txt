 Description:
 Bare Metal - Event-Triggered Systems (ETS)
 App - retarget_printf_to_Console
 Project for STM32 Project (STM32CubeIDE Version: 1.17.0)

  SystemCoreClock     => 64MHz (15.625nS)
  SysTick Rate Hertz  => 1000 ticks per second (1mS)

  app.c (app.h)
   Endless loops, which execute tasks with fixed computing time. This 
   sequential execution is only deviated from when an interrupt event occurs.

  task_test.c (task_test.h) 
   Non-Blocking & Update By Time Code -> Test Code Integration
  
  display.c (display.h)
   Non-Blocking Code -> Display Code Library

  logger.h (logger.c)
   Utilities for Retarget "printf" to Console

  dwt.h
   Utilities for Mesure "clock cycle" and "execution time" of code
  
  Special connection requirements:
   There are no special connection requirements for this example.
